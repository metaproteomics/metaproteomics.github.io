The Critical Assessment of Metaproteome Investigation (CAMPI) is a series of studies that aim to evaluate and improve the state-of-the-art in metaproteomics. These studies have been conducted over the years by a large number of research groups. The goal of CAMPI is to identify the strengths and limitations of current metaproteomics methods, and to develop new strategies and approaches to better understand the proteins present in a given environment. This overview page provides a summary of past and current CAMPI studies, including their findings and contributions to the field of metaproteomics.
