We are delighted to announce the birth of the Metaproteomics Initiative, an official Initiative of the European Proteomics Association (EuPA)!

We promote dissemination of metaproteomics and applications through collaborative networking in microbiome studies. We aim to be the central information hub and open meeting place where newcomers and experts interact to communicate and accelerate the improvement and standardization of experimental and bioinformatics methodologies. This will be achieved initially through this website, presentations, online communication channel, collaborative projects, and symposia.

**Currently, we're still looking for a shiny logo!**

Become a member (click [here](https://forms.gle/zAqJDPZNvf7vSoNi9)) and submit your original logo before **June 10th, 2021**. The winner wins a free spot for the next International Metaproteomics Symposium!

Please send your high-resolution proposal to **info@metaproteomics.org**. All proposals will be presented to the Metaproteomics Initiative community at the first online meeting scheduled mid-June. Everyone who's attending gets to vote for their favourite proposals. Remember, the best proposal is the one that illustrates best what the Metaproteomics Initiative is.

In the meantime, have a look at our website metaproteomics.org and follow us on Twitter ([@MetaP_Init](https://twitter.com/metap_init)).
