title: Interested in participating in CAMPI3?
---

We are collecting your interest in participating in CAMPI3 Study. If you are interested, we will send you mass spectrometry files, protein sequence database, parameters for searches for a ‘synthetic community’ dataset and a ‘biological dataset’. We will also share a reporting template so that you can share your results with us.

The results will be kept anonymous. We are not looking for the “right” way to do things, just trying to understand how decisions in different workflows impact assignments. We are looking for diverse perspectives and areas of expertise (tool developers, experimentalists, analysts, etc.)

You can express your interest [using this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfINIA-GHsBg8SPW8sWD47hh0RAgZLtL8ePaRTGJDZ2i29qBQ/viewform).
