The first symposium took place under the name of "*Symposium on Advances and Applications in Metaproteomics*".

Over the last decade, the research field of metaproteomics has emerged to an indispensable tool in microbial ecology to identify the link between community composition and functional profile. The progress of this area is driven by technical developments in mass spectrometry and various DNA shotgun sequencing projects of environmental samples. The complexity of the samples and the non-trivial data analysis, however, represent serious challenges that hinder the whole field of metaproteomic research from moving forward and to tackle challenging research topics, e.g. in environmental or health sciences.

In order to promote the scientific exchange in the community, this symposium covers the most important topics of metaproteomics. It is directed towards Postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, and other scientists with experience in related fields of microbiology who want to discover techniques of proteomic analysis. On the computational side, a half-day hands-on workshop is offered with guided tutorials for the MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA) data analysis software.
