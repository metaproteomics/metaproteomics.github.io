The second edition of the International Metaproteomics Symposium, entitled "*What can we learn about microbial communities and their functions?*", took place in Alghero (Sardinia, Italy) in June 14-16, 2017. The event was organized by Porto Conte Ricerche, a research center belonging to the Science and Technology Park of Sardinia, in collaboration with the Universities of Ghent (Belgium), Magdeburg (Germany) and Luxemburg (Luxemburg), and funded by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia through the Sardegna Ricerche agency.

The Symposium was attended by over 50 participants (including invited speakers and organizers) from 13 different countries. The four plenary sessions of the Symposium comprised 24 presentations dealing with a wide range of topics related to the metaproteomics field, including new methods, health and disease, environmental biotechnology and animal science, and bioinformatics. Furthermore, the Symposium program included three workshops/demonstrations, focused on bioinformatic platforms (Unipept, MetaProteome Analyzer, Galaxy for metaproteomics) and quantitative mass spectrometry applications, as well as a poster session.

The Symposium had been a nice opportunity for exchanging information about the state of the art in metaproteomics, for sharing new methods and tools useful for the field, as well as for starting and consolidating scientific collaborations, with the added value of the beautiful Sardinian landscape.
