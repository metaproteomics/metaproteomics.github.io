The last decade has shown that insights into ecosystem functioning of microbial communities are optimal studied when multiple Omics techniques are integrated. Thus, the focus was chosen as **Microbiome Research and Integrating Metaproteomics into a Multi-Omics Pipeline**.

This conference was the leading meeting point in this field and beside the bigshots. On December 3 to 5, 2018, more than 75 Ph.D. students and international scientists attended this meeting at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ, Leipzig, Germany. This was a unique opportunity for interested students and colleagues to discuss and to network at a very high-level for new ideas of interdisciplinary research in the future. Topics range from technical issues to microbiome biology in different habitats under the influence of various stressors. The symposium included a workshop (a cooperate study (**CAMPI**)), poster presentations, and an evaluation competition for best scientific posters. Another highlight was the conference dinner in the Tropical Hall at the Leipzig Zoo, where participants meet and discuss in a relaxed atmosphere, creating new networking and collaborations.

Invited speaker: Daniel Figeys (University of Ottawa, Kanada), Felipe Bastida (CEBAS-CSIC, Murcia, Spain)
