The last decade has shown that insights into ecosystem functioning of microbial communities are optimal studied when multiple Omics techniques are integrated. Thus, the focus was chosen as **Microbiome Research and Integrating Metaproteomics into a Multi-Omics Pipeline**.

On December 3 to 5, 2018, more than 75 Ph.D. students and international scientists attended this meeting at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ, Leipzig, Germany. This was a unique opportunity for interested students and colleagues to discuss and to network at a very high-level for new ideas of interdisciplinary research in the future. Topics range from technical issues to microbiome biology in different habitats under the influence of various stressors. The symposium included a cooperative study ([**CAMPI**](https://metaproteomics.org/collaborative_projects/)), poster presentations, and an evaluation competition for best scientific posters. Another highlight was the conference dinner in the Tropical Hall at the Leipzig Zoo, where participants could meet and discuss in a relaxed atmosphere, creating new networking and collaborations.

Invited speakers: Daniel Figeys (University of Ottawa, Kanada), Felipe Bastida (CEBAS-CSIC, Murcia, Spain)
