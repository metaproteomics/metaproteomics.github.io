## Welcome to the landing page of the Metaproteomics Initiative!

We got recently accepted as an official <a href="https://eupa.org/">EuPA</a> Initiative, but we're currently building the website.

If you're interested in who we are and what we're planning to do, you can already read our proposal <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3CF6SFnshh3KUZq6Tp67AHheFt4GunQqOkYhUDU6Cg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. 
Our first, community-driven study titled <i>"Critical Assessment of MetaProteome Investigation (CAMPI): Critical Assessment of Metaproteome Investigation (CAMPI): A Multi-Lab Comparison of Established Workflows"</i> is already available on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.433915v1">bioRxiv</a>.

If your lab would like to join us, please list your lab <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kd_RuRC6lNq-wYQyN0Suisi6hXvuIP7Y9vnUIix35gs/edit#">here</a>.

If you don't run a lab, or are not working in one, but would like to be informed about this Initiative, you can leave your contact details <a href="https://forms.gle/CUgvt7owKTkjncWG8">here</a>.

Thank you for your interest,<br>
