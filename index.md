## Welcome to the landing page of the Metaproteomics Initiative!

We got recently accepted as an official [EuPA](https://eupa.org/) Initiative, but we're currently building the website.

If you're interested in who we are and what we're planning to do, you can already read our proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3CF6SFnshh3KUZq6Tp67AHheFt4GunQqOkYhUDU6Cg/edit?usp=sharing). 
Our first, community-driven study titled *"Critical Assessment of MetaProteome Investigation (CAMPI): Critical Assessment of Metaproteome Investigation (CAMPI): A Multi-Lab Comparison of Established Workflows"* is already available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.433915v1).

If your lab would like to join us, please list your lab [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kd_RuRC6lNq-wYQyN0Suisi6hXvuIP7Y9vnUIix35gs/edit#).

If you don't run a lab, or are not working in one, but would like to be informed about this Initiative, you can leave your contact details [here](https://forms.gle/CUgvt7owKTkjncWG8).

Thank you for your interest,<br>
the Metaproteomics Intitiative
