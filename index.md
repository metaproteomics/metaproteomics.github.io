title: Welcome to the Metaproteomics Initiative!

---

We promote dissemination of metaproteomics and applications through collaborative networking in microbiome studies. We aim to be the central information hub and open  meeting place where newcomers and experts interact to communicate and accelerate the improvement and standardization of experimental and bioinformatics methodologies. This will be achieved initially through this website, presentations, online communication channel, collaborative projects, and symposia.

Since February 2021, we are recognized as an official [EuPA](https://eupa.org/) Initiative. Currently, we're in the start-up phase of our Initiative, but we warmly invite you to register your interest in this Inititive [here](https://forms.gle/zAqJDPZNvf7vSoNi9).

Thank you for your interest,<br>
the Metaproteomics Intitiative
