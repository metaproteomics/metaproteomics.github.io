      What is metaproteomics?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-slate-600">
      Metaproteomics - an expansion of proteomics-methodologies to study the protein 
      inventory of microbial communities â€“ provides a valuable tool linking the taxonomic 
      profile of a microbial community to its dynamic function. Introduced twenty years 
      ago, metaproteomics is today used for various applications in biomedicine, biotechnology, 
      and environmental science. For instance, metaproteomics approaches are now used for the
      identification of pathogenic microbial biomarkers and the study of poorly characterized
      microbiomes like the plant root-associated and aquatic microbiomes. Reflecting the broad
      and increasing field of applications, the portfolio of metaproteomics workflows has
      substantially diversified over the years and now offers a broad range of building blocks 
      of different wet-lab, data acquisition, and data processing procedures, meeting the demands 
      of its growing community.

      A vibrant community
    </h2>
    <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-slate-600">
      We promote dissemination of metaproteomics fundamentals, advancements, and
      applications through collaborative networking in microbiome research. We
      aim to be the central information hub and open meeting place where
      newcomers and experts interact to communicate, standardize and accelerate
      experimental and bioinformatic methodologies in this field. This will be
      achieved initially through this website, presentations, online
      communication channel, collaborative projects, and symposia. More
