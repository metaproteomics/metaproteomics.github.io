CAMPI3, the latest study initiated by the Metaproteomics Initiative, has been launched.

The CAMPI3 study aims to:

- Identify strengths and limitations of the bioinformatic workflows for protein assignment and peptide spectral matching quality among users at varying levels of expertise and experience in the field of metaproteomics.

- Evaluate the impact of key decision points that are commonly encountered across bioinformatic methods on taxonomic and functional annotation.

To facilitate your participation, we have prepared two datasets: a ground-truth “synthetic community” dataset and a biological dataset. These MS datasets and associated protein databases will serve as the foundation for your analyses. To get involved, we encourage you to download the data from [https://metaproteomics.org/campi3/download](https://metaproteomics.org/campi3/download) and leverage the provided reporting templates and metrics to ensure standardized sharing of results. (Note: The shared CAMPI3 data is to be used for the CAMPI3 study only. If participants would like to use it for other purposes, please reach out for permission from the CAMPI3 Team.)

We value your contributions and understand the importance of maintaining confidentiality. Rest assured that all submissions will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and kept anonymous throughout the study.

If you have any questions or require further information about CAMPI3, please visit [https://z.umn.edu/campi3faqs](https://z.umn.edu/campi3faqs). Moreover, the project coordinators (pjagtap@umn.edu, peterssl@ornl.gov, and benoit.kunath@uni.lu) are ready to assist you at every step of the process. Don't hesitate to reach out to them.
