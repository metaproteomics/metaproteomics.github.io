The Metaproteomics Initiative has announced the CAMPI3 study to assess the informatic methods used in the field of metaproteomics research. This is the latest study in the series of [CAMPI studies](https://metaproteomics.org/campi/) initiated by the Metaproteomics Initiative. Through this study, the Metaproteomics Initiative intends to understand how decisions in different workflows impact assignments. We are looking for diverse perspectives and areas of expertise (tool developers, experimentalists, analysts, etc.)

Interested participants will be sent mass spectrometry files, protein sequence database, and parameters for searches for a ‘synthetic community’ dataset and a ‘biological dataset’. Reporting templates and metrics will be provided so that you can share the results. The results will be kept anonymous.

Next Steps:
- Interested in participating? Fill in the survey: [z.umn.edu/campi3ing](https://z.umn.edu/campi3ing)
- Ready for results submission? Contact Anonymizer (ningzhibin@gmail.com)
- Questions? Contact pjagtap@umn.edu and peterssl@ornl.gov
