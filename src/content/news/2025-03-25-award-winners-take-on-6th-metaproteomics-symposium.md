As a first-time attendant of the International Metaproteomics Symposium I felt star-struck by the incredible researchers, whose names I recognized from the numerous papers I read since jumping onto the field two years ago. Having said that, everyone was kind, gracious and friendly, making my experience one of the best conferences I attended. It is a small field, now, but it seems to grow by leaps and bounds and it is important not only to have smart and innovative researchers, but also friendly and collegial to avoid the toxic environments that plague bigger and more competitive fields. I learned so much, technically and biologically during the meeting and plan to test and integrate some of the methods and tools presented in my lab. I had great scientific discussions and hope to start meaningful collaborations soon.

On a personal note, it was my second time to Oslo, but due to the weather and poor visibility outside, we could’ve been anywhere else in the world, and frankly, it didn’t matter, since the meeting was exceptional. Thus, ample congratulations are due to the organizing committee and members of the metaproteomics initiative. 

When I saw I was selected to be the last speaker I felt honored, yet a bit disappointed, as last speakers tend to get . Nonetheless, I was surprised by the number of people that remained till the end, and I was humbled to receive the Best Talk award. Luck of being last. Now I have a fancy Norwegian cheese cutter.

I’m looking forward to IMS7 in Germany next year and I’m sure it will be an awesome meeting. In the spirit of the IMS6 inspiring talk by Dr. Emma Timmins-Schiffman, can we please have IMS8 in Antarctica?

I would like to extend my gratitude for the opportunity to share my experience at the IMS6. This was my first attendance, and I was thrilled to be included in such a welcoming community. Held in the stunning city of Oslo, the conference provided a perfect blend of scientific talks and technical advancements that are critical to our field. The schedule incorporated sufficient time for discussions and networking, which led to productive conversations with peers and experts. As an early career researcher, it was reassuring to find a community that truly understands the challenges and methodological gaps in metaproteomics. I especially appreciated the CAMPI discussion, as it showcased a sense of scientific collaboration, where everyone aimed to support each other and focus on tackling the challenges ahead. I look forward to participating in future IMS and actively building on the connections I established. I am also honoured to have received the Best Poster Award, which is a motivating step forward in my career and reinforces my commitment to advancing in this field.

Oslo and Norway were stunning, and the venue was especially impressive. I'd like to thank the organizers again for putting together such a great conference. It was really interesting to see all the new trends in metaproteomics workflows, like de novo, isotopes, and DIA. It was also great to get a good overview of how useful metaproteomics is. I'm still amazed at how much valuable info we can get from all microbiomes. We can then use that info to develop strategies to combat climate change, treat diseases, or optimize bioprocesses, for example. As someone who's not a bioinformatician, it's also awesome to find out about helpful new tools and pipelines that make my daily science life easier. Thanks again to the EUPA for the travel grant!

Attending the IMS in Oslo was a fantastic experience! As a doctoral student, I had the opportunity to engage in insightful discussions, connect with experts in the field, and follow current research trends. Presenting my work on AI-powered design of simplified microbial communities and winning the Best Poster Award was a true honor and a great motivation. A heartfelt thank you to my supervisors, Dr. Jean Armengaud and Dr. Lucia Grenga, for their invaluable guidance and support. I am truly grateful to the Metaproteomics Initiative and organisers for creating such a dynamic environment.

The international Metaproteomics Symposium has quickly become one of the events I’m looking forward the most. Currently being in between jobs, the travel grant was instrumental in allowing me to join this year. I’m very grateful I was able to join, share my results and discuss new ideas and collaborations. Clearly, a lot of things are happening in the metaproteomics field, and this symposium really is a driving force that facilitate and stimulate a lot of great interactions. I’m always extremely motivated after this event and cannot wait for what’s coming next.
