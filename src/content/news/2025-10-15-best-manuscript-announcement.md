# MPI Best Manuscript Award 2026
We are excited to announce the next round of the Metaproteomics Initiative’s Best Manuscript Award, which will be presented at the 7th International Metaproteomics Symposium, taking place June 22-25, 2026 in Dessau-Rösslau, Germany.

The Best Manuscript Award was established to give early career researchers (ECRs) the opportunity to gain visibility in the metaproteomics community and to highlight their important contributions to the field of metaproteomics.

We encourage all ECRs to participate with a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal or available on a preprint server between November 1, 2024 and March 1, 2026.  The winner will be given the opportunity to present their work in a dedicated plenary session. 

**Application deadline: March 01, 2026.**

## Eligibility criteria
The competition is solely intended for ECRs (PhD not yet obtained or awarded after June 1, 2020). Applicants must be members of the Metaproteomics Initiative. Leave of absence (e.g., parental leave or illness) will be taken into account.

## Publication criteria
The applicant must have made a significant contribution to the publication as (joint) first or (joint) last author. The publication must be an original research article. Review articles are not eligible; however, short communications and methods papers are welcome. The manuscript must be accepted by a journal or available on a preprint server at the time of submission to the competition. Eligible manuscripts must not have been available on a preprint server or accepted before November 1, 2024, and must be in English.

## How to apply
A complete application needs to be sent by email to info@metaproteomics.org before <span style="color: red;">March 1, 2026</span>.

The application should include:
* PDF file of the manuscript (including the supplementary information, if it applies).
* A 300-word statement highlighting the significance and impact of the work.
* (Optional) A declaration of any leave of absence along with the exact dates and duration.

## Selection Process
A committee consisting of members of the Metaproteomics Initiative advisory board will evaluate the applications based on:

* Impact of the work for the metaproteomics community
* Quality/state-of-the-art of the workflow, including the wet lab methods, data acquisition and data analysis parts, as well as adherence to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles

The three top manuscripts will be shared with the community in May 2026, and all Metaproteomics Initiative members will be invited to vote for their preferred manuscript before the 7th International Metaproteomics Symposium in Dessau-Rösslau.
